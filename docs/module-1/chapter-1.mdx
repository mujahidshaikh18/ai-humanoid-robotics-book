# Introduction to Physical AI & ROS 2

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), laying the groundwork for understanding how artificial intelligence integrates with physical robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and its significance in robotics
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2
- Understand the relationship between AI and physical robotic systems
- Identify key components of the ROS 2 ecosystem

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital environments, Physical AI deals with the challenges of perception, decision-making, and action in the real world.

### Key Characteristics of Physical AI

1. **Real-time Processing**: Physical AI systems must process information and respond in real-time to dynamic environments.
2. **Multi-modal Perception**: Integration of visual, auditory, tactile, and other sensory inputs.
3. **Embodied Cognition**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between the AI system and its physical embodiment.
4. **Uncertainty Management**: Dealing with sensor noise, actuator limitations, and environmental unpredictability.

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the next-generation robotics framework that provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It addresses the limitations of ROS 1 and provides a more robust, scalable, and production-ready platform.

### Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 was developed to address several key requirements:
- **Real-time support**: Critical for time-sensitive robotic applications
- **Multi-robot systems**: Better support for distributed robotic systems
- **Production deployment**: Ready for industrial and commercial applications
- **Security**: Built-in security features for safe deployment
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Support for various operating systems and architectures

### Core Concepts

#### Nodes
In ROS 2, computation is broken into nodes that communicate with each other through messages. Each node can perform a specific function and communicate with other nodes.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1
```

#### Topics and Messages
Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Messages are the data structures that are passed between nodes.

#### Services
Services provide a request/reply communication pattern, allowing nodes to request specific actions from other nodes.

#### Actions
Actions are like services but designed for long-running tasks that may provide feedback and can be canceled.

## Setting Up Your ROS 2 Environment

### Installation

ROS 2 supports multiple platforms including Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. For this book, we'll focus on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) with ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy or Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Source the ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Check ROS 2 installation
ros2 --version

# List available ROS 2 commands
ros2

# Find available packages
ros2 pkg list
```

## Physical AI in Robotics Applications

Physical AI has enabled significant advances in robotics, including:

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Robots that can navigate complex environments
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Systems that can understand and respond to human behavior
- **Adaptive Manipulation**: Robots that can handle objects with varying properties
- **Learning from Demonstration**: Robots that can acquire new skills from human examples

## Summary

This chapter introduced the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and ROS 2. We explored the relationship between AI and physical systems, and began our journey into understanding how ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for building sophisticated robotic applications.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into the core architecture of ROS 2, exploring its communication patterns and system design principles.
