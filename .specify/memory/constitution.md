# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
All factual claims and technical assertions MUST be verified against primary sources. This ensures the foundational correctness of all presented information.

### II. Clarity
Content MUST be written for an academic audience with a computer science background, ranging from beginners to experts. Explanations should be precise, unambiguous, and foster deep understanding.

### III. Reproducibility
All claims, experiments, and code examples MUST be reproducible and traceable to their sources. This includes explicit citations for algorithms, methodologies, and data.

### IV. Rigor
Preference MUST be given to peer-reviewed academic sources. All presented concepts MUST reflect established scientific and engineering principles in AI and robotics.
